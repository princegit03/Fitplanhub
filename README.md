# Fitplanhub
FitPlanHub is a backend-based fitness platform built using Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. The application supports two roles: users and trainers. Trainers can create, update, and delete fitness plans, while users can browse available plans and subscribe to them through a simulated payment process. Access to plan details is controlled based on subscription status, where non-subscribed users can only view limited information such as the plan title and price, and subscribed users can access full plan details. The project uses JWT for authentication and bcrypt for secure password storage. Role-based access control ensures that only trainers can manage plans, while users can follow and unfollow trainers to receive a personalized feed of fitness plans created by trainers they follow. This project mainly focuses on backend fundamentals such as authentication, authorization, database relationships, and REST API design, and was developed as part of a technical assignment to demonstrate practical backend development skills.
